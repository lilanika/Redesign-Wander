### Build with Express, Handlebars, MongoDB, MapBox API in 5 days during Ironhacks bootcamp

## The project
After Oriane Magnin, Luke Palmer and I built Wander with React, Express and MongoDB during the Ironhack Bootcamp, I redesigned the MERN stack app. In the process, I learned better UI design, how to cleverly use the checkbox for a sidebar, integrate dark mode with Local storage, and generally better UI design code.  This is what came out of it! Wanda will get 3 different responsive formats in the next few days to fit any device. Real feedback is welcome :-)
