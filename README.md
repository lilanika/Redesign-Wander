### Build with Express, Handlebars, MongoDB, MapBox API in 5 days during Ironhacks bootcamp

## The project --> https://wander-share-your-spots.herokuapp.com/
Wander is a full-stack application to save your favourite places around the world. This Full stack app was created during the Ironhack Bootcamp and was the first big project in collaboration with Oriane Magnin and Luke Palmer. I took my time to create a redesign because I wanted to improve my skills in frontend and UI design. I learned how to use the checkbox for a sidebar and how to integrate dark mode with local storage. A long term goal could be to make Wander social media capable and turn it into a mobile app 💪🏼

❤️ suitable for all devices | 🌒 toggle between dark and light mode| 🔍 Filter by categories | ✏️ Add a note to the location, change the color tag according to their categories or delete a spot to keep your personal list of the most beautiful places in the world up to date. | ⏰ 5 days without redesign
